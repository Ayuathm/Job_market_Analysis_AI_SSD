To achieve this ambitious aim, DAI will improve the effectiveness of\\nlocal systems and strengthen the capacities of community groups to achieve gender responsive and\\ndiversified market-sensitive production; facilitate increased production of diverse nutritious foods by\\nstrengthening productivity, reducing food loss, and improving nutrition behaviors; and strengthen and\\nexpand household and community opportunities for sustainable, locally driven livelihoods. The RASS\\nActivity will apply the resilience pathways approach. This approach entails implementing interventions\\niteratively and modifying them as circumstances change to ensure that households and communities\\nhave increased social cohesion, stronger local structures and capacity, and productive and sustainable\\ndiverse livelihoods to mitigate, adapt to, and recover from shocks and stresses; and graduating them\\nfrom high to low Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) levels. Hence, reducing dependency on emergency\\nhumanitarian assistance and enhances the transition to inclusive development assistance and economic\\ngrowth.\\n\\nCONTEXT AND GENERAL TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS\\n\\nRASS will work through local partners to ensure the sustainability and local ownership of RASS\\ninterventions\\u2014building the capacity of local partners and local stakeholders, where it is needed.
